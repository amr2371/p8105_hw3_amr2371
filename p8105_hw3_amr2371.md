### Problem 1

#### Read in the data

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

#### Answer questions about the data

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
resprenting a single product from an instacart order. Variables include
identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which each
product was added to the cart. There are several order-level variables,
describing the day and time of the order, and number of days since prior
order. Then there are several item-specific variables, describing the
product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs,
produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item
has been ordered by this user in the past. In total, there are 39123
products found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.

Below is a table summarizing the number of items ordered from aisle. In
total, there are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits
holding the most items ordered by far.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

Next is a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle.
Here, aisles are ordered by ascending number of items.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_amr2371_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="90%" />

Our next table shows the three most popular items in aisles
`baking ingredients`, `dog food care`, and `packaged vegetables fruits`,
and includes the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

Finally is a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. This
table has been formatted in an untidy manner for human readers. Pink
Lady Apples are generally purchased slightly earlier in the day than
Coffee Ice Cream, with the exception of day 5.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_hour) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

## Problem 2

Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset should
include all originally observed variables and values; have useful
variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data
with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting dataset
(e.g. what variables exist, how many observations, etc).

``` r
accel <- read.csv("./accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "minutes",
    values_to = "activity_count") %>% 
  mutate(minutes = str_sub(minutes, 10),
         minutes = as.integer(minutes),
         day = forcats::fct_relevel(day, "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"),
         type_of_day = ifelse(day == "Saturday" | day == "Sunday", "weekend", "weekday"))
```

The dataset has 50400 observations and 6 variables. The variables in the
dataset are minute of the day, activity count, and day of the week. The
resulting data set has a variable that observes if the day is a weekday
or weekend.

Here we have a table that summarizes the activity count per day for the
entire time period.

``` r
accel %>% 
  group_by(day,week) %>% 
   summarize(tot_activity = sum(activity_count)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = day,
              values_from = tot_activity) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'day'. You can override using the `.groups`
    ## argument.

| week | Sunday |    Monday |  Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday |   Friday | Saturday |
|-----:|-------:|----------:|---------:|----------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
|    1 | 631105 |  78828.07 | 307094.2 |    340115 | 355923.6 | 480542.6 |   376254 |
|    2 | 422018 | 295431.00 | 423245.0 |    440962 | 474048.0 | 568839.0 |   607175 |
|    3 | 467052 | 685910.00 | 381507.0 |    468869 | 371230.0 | 467420.0 |   382928 |
|    4 | 260617 | 409450.00 | 319568.0 |    434460 | 340291.0 | 154049.0 |     1440 |
|    5 | 138421 | 389080.00 | 367824.0 |    445366 | 549658.0 | 620860.0 |     1440 |

The last two Saturdays only count the number of minutes in a day so
those days have the least activity but we observe that the activity is
highest on Monday, Friday and Saturday.

Below we observe a graph sowing the activity count for each day

``` r
accel %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=minutes,y=activity_count,group=day_id, color=day))+
  geom_line()+
  labs(title = "Activity Count for Each Day per the minute",
       x = "Time of Day (min)",
       y = "Activity Count")
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_amr2371_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />
In the later part of the day we see a lot of activity on Saturday’s. On
Friday’s there also seems to be a lot of activity in the later minutes
but we also see a lot of activity around the middle of the day.On
Sunday’s we see a lot of activity during the middle of the day.

## Problem 3

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and indicating the extent to which
missing data is an issue. Then, do or answer the following (commenting
on the results of each):

Make a two-panel plot showing (i) tmax vs tmin for the full dataset
(note that a scatterplot may not be the best option); and (ii) make a
plot showing the distribution of snowfall values greater than 0 and less
than 100 separately by year.

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("ny_noaa")
ny_noaa =ny_noaa %>% janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("year","month","day"),sep="-") %>% 
  mutate(
    month = as.numeric(month),
    day = as.numeric(day),
    year = as.numeric(year),
    tmax= as.numeric(tmax),
    tmin= as.numeric(tmin),
    month = as.character(month),
    year = as.character(year)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(tmax=tmax/10,
         tmin=tmin/10,
         snow=snow/10)
```

The data set has 2595176 observations and 9 variables. The data set
contains information on the maximum temperatures and the minimum
temperatures on days of the year. It also contains information on how
much snow and rain were observed on those days of the year. After
creating separate variables for day, month and year, it seemed as if the
tmax and tmin were in degrees Celsius but scaled up by a factor of 10 so
to put it into normal units I have divided them by 10 to get them back
into degrees Celsius. The snow variable seems to be in mm so I have
divided them by 10 as well to get them in cm instead. There is a lot of
missing data because it does not snow all year so there are a lot of 0’s
and missing data for the snow category. The most common value snow is 0.

``` r
ny_noaa_tmax = 
  ny_noaa %>% 
  group_by( day,month, year) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm=TRUE))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'day', 'month'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
ny_noaa_tmax %>% 
  filter(month==01 | month==07)%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day, y=mean_tmax, color= month))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_grid(. ~ month)
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_amr2371_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="90%" />
Bewteen January and July we see that the minimum temperatures are much
lower for January while we see most of the maximum tempaeratures for
January still being lower than the minimum temperatures for July. There
is a clear divide in the temperature ranges for the two months. There is
one clear outlier from the graph above in the month of July that goes
below 20 degrees Celsius as the mean tempaerature for that day.

``` r
tmin = ny_noaa %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, fill = month))+
 geom_density(alpha=0.5) 

tmax = ny_noaa %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmax, fill = month))+
 geom_density(alpha=0.5) 

tmin + tmax
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_amr2371_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="90%" />
From the graph above, we see that tmax is higher than tmin as expected
but the spread for month 7 which is July seems very similar. For months
10 and 11 we see that the tmin is failr similar. Overall, tmax is more
spread out than tmin for the entire data set and the tmax for July is
much higher than the other months.

``` r
ny_noaa %>% 
  filter( snow < 100 & snow > 0) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y = snow)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_amr2371_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="90%" />
The median snowfall for all the years from 1981 to 2010 seems fairly
similar. All of the years have outliers where it tends to snow more in
certain years such as 2002 over other years such as 2006.
